# dungeoncrawler

Interested in learning C# and Unity to maybe make some games in the future, so started following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8YUfee_pzc&t=822s&ab_channel=Epitome and making a simple dungeon crawler. The spritesheet is from https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-dungeon-tileset.
